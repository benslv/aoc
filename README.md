# Advent of Code
This repo is for all my solutions to the different years of Advent of Code (AoC). They're not all complete because...well, AoC gets ***hard*** and I usually stop once the problems take me more than about a day to complete (otherwise I can't keep pace with them).

My goal each year is usuallly just to beat the number of days I managed in the previous year, as it seems like a pretty decent indicator of how much I've improved. Probably going to go back through the older years and tackle those too.

I mainly do these challenges in Python and JavaScript, as I feel suuuper comfortable writing in them and don't *really* want the syntax of the language to be the bottleneck, but recently I've decided to try and tackle some of them in Rust as it seems like a pretty neat language to have in my kit. So, expect to see some of that!
